# MySQL-One-to-Many-Joins
The intention of this repo is to explain and contrast the different types of Joins you can establish using SQL in a One to Many relationship schema. Primarily we are working with two tables: Customers and Orders. I also cover the importance of the ON DELETE CASCADE function in creating a schemas with foreign keys. A challenge selection of problems is included at the end along with reasoning and clarification for my solutions. Thanks for stopping by!
